# PyBer_Analysis
## Overview of the Analysis
The purpose of this analysis is to analyze the ride sharing data of our ride service, based on the type of city where the service is being used. With this analysis, we will be able to make important business decisions such as using different forms of marketing to attract riders or finding new ways to recruit more drivers in cities where they're needed. We will consider number of rides, drivers per location, average fare per locations in our analysis to visualize entire ride sharing services currently offered to determine affordability for underserved neighborhoods.

Looking at our results in a pie chart shows us all the same results in a format that is a lot faster to look at. From the results, we can see that urban areas have the majority of fares collected, rides completed, and drivers working with the service.

By comparing the average fare per rides between each city type, rural cities have highest average fare per ride than suburban and urban by around four dollars and 10 dollars, respectively. For the column of average fare per driver, rural cities also perform well than suburban and urban cities by 40% and 230%. The reason is that the rides and drivers count of rural cities, significantly lower than urban and suburban cities. It leads to average values greater than urban and suburban.

## Business Recommendations
- We should hire more drivers in suburban and rural areas. This would bring the ride price down in those areas, which can lead to more people using the service.

- PyBer should increase their marketing budgets the in all areas. Your market is so oversaturated that many of your drivers are not receiving work. Increasing the number of customers would be a great first step.

- We can introduce some offers for Suburban cities based on holidays to improve number of rides which eventually will increase total revenue.
